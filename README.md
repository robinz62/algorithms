# algorithms

Various data structures and algorithms in Java. Most files contain a `main`
method that gives a simple demonstration of the algorithm (and can be used to
verify correctness (hopefully)).

* `/algorithms`: miscellaneous algorithms
* `/data-structures`: data structures
  * `/minified`: same data structures but with reduced code length (e.g. no
    comments, reduced exception checking) and non-public privacy (for copy
    pasting).
