# algorithms

Various data structures and algorithms in Java. Ideally these should all be
tested but that takes a lot of work so I really hope these just work.

* `/algorithms`: miscellaneous algorithms
* `/data-structures`:
  * `/documented`: data structures with good style and documentation.
  * `/minified`: data structures with competitive programming-style syntax,
    featuring no documentation, shorter code, public instance variables for
    easier debugging.
