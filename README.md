# algorithms

Various data structures and algorithms in Java. Most files contain a `main`
method that gives a simple demonstration of the algorithm (and can be used to
verify correctness (hopefully)).

* `/algorithms`: miscellaneous algorithms
* `/data-structures`: data structures
  * `/minified`: same data structures but with changes such as reduced code
    length (e.g. no comments, reduced exception checking), non-public privacy
    (for copy pasting), and micro-optimizations (e.g. bit shifts)
