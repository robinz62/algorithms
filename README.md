# algorithms

Various data structures and algorithms in Java. Ideally these should all be
tested but that takes a lot of work so I really hope these just work.

* `/algorithms`: miscellaneous algorithms
* `/data-structures`: data structures
  * `/minified`: same data structures but with changes such as reduced code
    length (e.g. no comments, reduced exception checking), non-public privacy
    (for copy pasting), and micro-optimizations that may or may not matter
    (e.g. bit operations)
