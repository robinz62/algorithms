# algorithms

Various data structures and algorithms in Java / C++. The Java files should
mostly work but there may be a few that haven't been tested.

Alas, I have finally come to starting to use C++ in early 2022. Time to rebuild
a bunch of algorithms. For C++, I will add the various data structures/algs as
needed to solve problems, which will help ensure all of it has been properly
tested.
